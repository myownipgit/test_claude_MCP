## Overview

This repository serves as a testing ground for exploring Claude's capabilities in multi-agent task processing and collaboration. It demonstrates how multiple AI agents can work together to solve complex problems through structured communication and task delegation.

## Features

- 🤖 Multi-agent system architecture
- 🔄 Task delegation and coordination
- 💬 Inter-agent communication protocols
- 📊 Performance monitoring and optimization
- 🛠️ Extensible framework for adding new agents

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myownipgit/test_claude_MCP.git
cd test_claude_MCP
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash

## Usage

Basic example of how to use the system:

```python
from mcp.agents import Agent
from mcp.tasks import Task

# Initialize agents
agent1 = Agent("Agent1")
agent2 = Agent("Agent2")

# Create and assign tasks
task = Task("Example task")
result = agent1.collaborate_with(agent2, task)
```
