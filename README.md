## Overview

This repository serves as a testing ground for implementing Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources. The MCP provides a universal way to integrate various data sources with AI models, replacing fragmented integrations with a standardized protocol.

## Features

- 🔄 Standardized data source integration
- 🔌 Universal connection protocol
- 🚀 Streamlined AI-data communication
- 📊 Efficient data retrieval and context management
- 🛠️ Extensible interface for different data sources

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myownipgit/test_claude_MCP.git
cd test_claude_MCP
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic example of how to implement MCP:

```python
from mcp.protocol import MCPClient
from mcp.connectors import DataSourceConnector

# Initialize MCP client
client = MCPClient()

# Connect to a data source
connector = DataSourceConnector("example_source")
client.register_connector(connector)

# Query data through MCP
result = client.query("example query")
```
